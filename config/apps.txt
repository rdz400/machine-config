# list of applications I should install whenever I reinstall windows
# these names are not following any conventions other than them being lower case
# some of these are utilities for which the installation is automated by scripts
# elsewhere in this repo
# concerning this file. Every line that does not begin with a hash tag should be
# ignored (if I ever want to do something with this file programmatically)
# empty lines have no meaning and are ignored as well
# configuration for these files is not maintained in this list

# Would be nice to check which ones are available with winget
